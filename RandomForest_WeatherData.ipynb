    "\n",
    "The random forest algorithm is a form of supervised learning. Random Forests are a form of decision trees. In the algorithm, trees are built by choosing a random subset of variables and then the model averages the predicitons of all the trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest algorithm is most often used when there is a mixture of numeric and factor variables. Before using the random forest algorithm, here are some pros and cons to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pros\n",
    "* You can obtain a reliable variable importance plot that ranks the variables by how helpful they are in predicting the response.\n",
    "* The algorithm is effectively able to fill in missing information based on what information is present.\n",
    "* The estimate for the generalization error progresses as the forest builds, and is unbiased.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cons\n",
    "* This is a black box algorithm - meaning, though it is powerful for predicting, it is difficult to interpret.\n",
    "* When working with a dataset with significant noise, the algorithm will overfit.\n",
    "* Variable importance is biased towards categorical variables with more levels. \n",
    "* Due to overfitting, the algorithm performs poorly with predicting future data if there is any seasonality."
